         <h1>WHAT NEUROSCIENCE IS FOR:</h1>
         <p>Neuroscience is a multidisciplinary science that is concerned with the
           study of the structure and function of the nervous system. It encompasses
           the evolution, development, cellular and molecular biology, physiology,
           anatomy and pharmacology of the nervous system, as well as computational,
           behavioural and cognitive neuroscience.
        <br>
        <br>
        Motivation, defined as the energizing of behavior in pursuit of a goal, is
        a fundamental element of our interaction with the world and with each other.
         All animals share motivation to obtain their basic needs, including food,
         water, sex and social interaction. Meeting these needs is a requirement for
         survival, but in all cases the goals must be met in appropriate quantities
         and at appropriate times. Therefore motivational drive must be modulated as
         a function of both internal states as well as external environmental conditions.
        <br>
        <br>
       In the past few decades, there has been a great deal of research on the biology
       and psychology of motivation. This work includes the investigation of specific
       aspects of motived behavior using multiple levels of analyses, which allows for
       the identification of the underpinning neurobiological mechanisms that support
       relevant psychological processes. In this chapter we provide an overview to the
       volume "The Behavioural Neuroscience of Motivation".

            <p class="card-text"><br>We’ve been taught that if you dream big, work hard, have a positive mindset, learn from your mistakes, and persist, you can be anything you want in life.

But brain imaging has shown that it takes some help from a healthy, sharp brain to achieve your potential. At Amen Clinics, we perform brain imaging called single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), which looks at blood flow and activity patterns in the brain. Since 1991, we have performed more than 135,000 brain SPECT scans on patients from 120 countries. SPECT has taught us four important lessons about the brain that show why it’s instrumental to a person’s success.</p>

</h5>
        <p class="card-text"><br>Is there really a recipe for success? According to science, there is -- or at any rate, there’s a general roadmap that’s proven to have a positive impact. In fact, according to neuroscientist Michael Merzenich, 30 hours of training based on specific neuroscience techniques can improve memory and cognition, speech patterns and reading comprehension.</p>
